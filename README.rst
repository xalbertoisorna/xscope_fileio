Xscope FileIO
=============

This library allows a program on the xCore to access binary files on the host machine
via xscope.

Currently it supports:

  * Arbitrary number (32 currently) of **read or write** files (not read/write)

  * “wb” or “rb” file access mode only

  * 6-8MBytes/s Device to Host speed

  * Up to 1MBytes/s Host to Device speed (on tools 15.0.4)

This compares to around 2kBytes/s for fileio over JTAG supported using ``xrun --io``.

Installation
************

``pip install -e .`` or ``pip install .``

To compile firmware code, add ``src_xcore`` to your source dirs and include dirs.

**Ensure you use the config.xscope included in src_xcore.**

If running on a Windows host, you will have to build the host endpoint yourself; the resulting executable
``xscope_host_endpoint.exe`` must be placed in the ``host`` directory. The specific commands will vary depending
on your build system, but you can use ``cmake`` to generate build files for your build system using the ``-G``
option, eg. ``cmake -G"NMake Makefiles" .``


Host side API
-------------

The host-side interface is written in Python. To run an xcore binary with access to
xscope fileIO,
use:

::

    xscope_fileio.run_on_target(adapter_id, firmware_xe, use_xsim=False)

This can be combined with xtagctl e.g.:

::

    with xtagctl.acquire("XCORE-AI-EXPLORER") as adapter_id:
        xscope_fileio.run_on_target(adapter_id, device_xe)


Device side API
---------------

Source and header files for device code are found in ``src_xcore``

::

    void xscope_io_init(chanend_t xscope_end);

    unsigned xscope_fileio_is_initialized(void);

    xscope_file_t xscope_open_file(char* filename, char* attributes);

    //NOTE MAXIMUM n_bytes_to_read of 64kB on Linux http://bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=18528
    size_t xscope_fread(xscope_file_t *xscope_io_handle, uint8_t *buffer, size_t n_bytes_to_read);

    void xscope_fwrite(xscope_file_t *xscope_io_handle, uint8_t *buffer, size_t n_bytes_to_write);

    void xscope_fseek(xscope_file_t *xscope_io_handle, int offset, int whence);

    int xscope_ftell(xscope_file_t *xscope_file);

    void xscope_close_all_files(void);

The device side application requires a multi-tile main since it uses the xscope_host_data(xscope_chan); service
to communicate with the host, which requires this. See examples for XC and C applications for how to do this.

You will also need a copy of ``config.xscope`` in your firmware directory. This
enables xscope in the tools and sets up the xscope probes used by fileio for communicating with the host app. You
can find a copy in ``xscope_fileio/config.xscope xscope_fileio/config.xscope.txt`` which you should rename to ``config.xscope``.

Note currently missing from fileio api:

::

    fprintf,  fscanf


System Architecture
-------------------

The ``run_on_target`` function calls ``xrun --xscope-port`` with the binary and specified target adapter,
and simultaneously launches a host application to communicate xscope data to/from
the xrun process via sockets. The host application responds to ``xscope_fileio`` API calls
in the firmware code, reading/writing to the host file system.

The call to ``run_on_target`` returns when the firmware exits.
